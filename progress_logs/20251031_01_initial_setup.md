# Progress Log - 2025-10-31_01_initial_setup

**Date:** 2025-10-31

**Action:** Created the new workspace directory `d:\HTSUSjohnway-SEP10\federal_register-master\ts_microservices_implementation` along with its subdirectories:
- `docs`
- `progress_logs`
- `src`
- `tests`

**Action:** Created `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` in the new workspace.

**Action:** Generated the `ruby_gem_analysis_summary_20251031.md` document, summarizing the architecture and functionality of the original `federal_register` Ruby Gem based on a comprehensive review of all its files. This document serves as the foundational specification for the TypeScript re-implementation.

**Next Steps:**
- Based on the `ruby_gem_analysis_summary_20251031.md`, identify logical microservice boundaries and outline the design of the TypeScript adapters.
- Begin scaffolding the core TypeScript classes (e.g., `Client`, `Base`, `ResultSet`, `Document`).
