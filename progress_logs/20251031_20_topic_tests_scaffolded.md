# Progress Log - 2025-10-31_20_topic_tests_scaffolded

**Date:** 2025-10-31

**Action:** Scaffolded the test file for the `Topic` class:

-   `tests/topic.test.ts`: Implemented unit tests for `Topic`'s constructor, attribute getters, and `static suggestions()` method. Tests use mocked `Client.get` to simulate API responses.

**Next Steps:**
- Create an `index.ts` to export all adapters and models.
- Develop a main aggregator service.
- Implement remaining tests for specific facet types.
